  abstract = {The paper presents various Metamodel-Assisted Evolution 
Strategies, which reduce the computational cost of 
optimisation problems involving time-consuming function 
evaluations. The metamodel is built from previously 
evaluated solutions in the search space and utilized 
to predict the fitness of new candidate solutions. 
In addition to previous works by the authors the new 
metamodel takes also account the error associated with 
each prediction, by correlating neighboring points in 
the search space. A mathematical problem and the problem 
of designing an optimal airfoil shape under viscious flow 
considerations have been worked out. Both demonstrate the 
gain in computational time the use of metamodels in Evolution 
strategies may offer.}

covariance matrix adaptation (CMA), is modified with the goal to speed up the
algorithm in terms of needed number of generations.  The idea of
the modification of the algorithm is to adapt the covariance matrix in
a faster way than in the original version by using a larger amount of
the information contained in large populations.  The original version
of the CMA was designed to reliably adapt the covariance matrix in
small populations and turned out to be highly efficient in this
case. The modification scales up the efficiency to population sizes of
up to n, where n ist the problem dimension.  If enough
processors are available, the use of large populations and thus of
evaluating a large number of search points per generation is not a
problem since the algorithm can be easily parallelized.

  abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the “strengths” of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of  the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.}

similar patterns.
In this paper, memetic algorithms (MAs) - genetic algorithms incorporating

Two new mutation and recombination operators are studied within the memetic
framework for clustering gene expression data. The memetic algorithms using
a sophisticated recombination operator are shown to converge very quickly
to (near-)optimum solutions.
Furthermore, the MAs are shown to be superior to

To this end, we define a simple pseudo-Boolean bi-objective problem ($\textsc{Lotz}$: leading ones - trailing zeroes) and investigate time required to find the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions.
It is shown that different multi-objective generalizations of a (1+1) evolutionary algorithm (EA) as well as a simple population-based evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (SEMO) need on average at least $\Omega(n^3)$ steps to optimize this function.
We propose the fair evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (FEMO) and prove that this algorithm performs a black box optimization in $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$ function evaluations where $n$ is the number of binary decision variables.

in multi-objective optimization, where the aim is to
approximate the set of Pareto-optimal solutions.
We integrate the model building and sampling techniques of a special
EDA called Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, based on binary decision
trees, into an evolutionary multi-objective optimizer using a special
selection scheme. 
The behavior of the resulting Bayesian Multi-objective Optimization
Algorithm (BMOA) is empirically investigated on the multi-objective
knapsack problem.}

Low-weight edges predominate in optimal solutions to these problems, and the performance of evolutionary algorithms for them is often im-proved by biasing their operators to favor these edges. From the distri-butions of edges  ranks in optimal solutions to these two problems, we identify probabilities for edges that minimize the average expected time until mutation chooses them for inclusion in a solution.

the reliability of the search, the final fitness achieved, 
the ability to cope with changing environments, 
and the robustness to high mutation rates, may all be improved by employing
this strategy. In this paper we dispute these claims, arguing
that adding {\em random} redundancy cannot be generally useful for
optimization purposes. By way of example we 
report on a number of experiments where the
random Boolean network encoding is compared to a direct encoding
in two mutation-only EAs, at various mutation rates. 
Our findings show that with the appropriate choice of 
per-bit mutation rate, the evolvability of populations using 
the direct encoding is no less than with the redundant one.}

It is not possible to describe those subproblems of NP-hard optimization problems where certain evolutionary algorithms work in polynomial time. Therefore, fitness landscapes based on important computer science problems as sorting and  shortest paths problems are investigated here. Although it cannot be expected that evolutionary algorithms outperform
the well-known problem specific algorithms on these simple
problems, it is interesting to analyze how evolutionary algorithms work on these fitness landscapes which are based on practical problems.
The following results are obtained:
* Sorting is the maximization of ``sortedness'' which is measured by one of several well-known measures of presortedness. The different measures of presortedness lead to fitness landscapes of quite different difficulty for EAs.
* Shortest paths problems are hard for all types of EA, if they are considered as single-objective optimization problems, while they are easy as multi-objective optimization problems.

In this paper we briefly discuss existing bloat-control techniques, then introduce two new kinds of non-parametric parsimony pressure, Direct and Proportional Tournament.  As their names suggest, these techniques are based on simple modifications of tournament selection to consider both size and fitness, but not together as a combined parametric equation.  We compare the techniques against, and in combination with, the most popular genetic programming bloat-control technique, Koza-style depth limiting, and show that they are effective in limiting size while still maintaining good best-fitness-of-run results.

  abstract = {The optimization of structures is important for many industrial
applications. But the problem of structure optimization is 
hardly understood. In the field of evolutionary computation mostly
syntactical (pure structure-based) variation operators are used. For this
kind of variation operators it is difficult to integrate domain-knowledge
and to control the size of a mutation step. To gain insight into the
basic problems of structure optimization we analyze
mutation operators for evolutionary programming. For a synthetic problem
we are able to derive a semantical mutation operator.
The semantical mutation operator makes use
of domain knowledge and has a well-defined parameter to adjust the
step size.}

updating the population in a cellular genetic algorithm (cGA). Cellular GA's are regular
GA's with the important exception that individuals are placed in a given geographical
distribution (usually a 2-d grid). Operators are applied locally on a set made of each
individual and the surrounding neighbors, thus promoting intra-neighborhood exploitation
and inter-neighborhood exploration of the search space. Here, we analyze the respective
advantages and drawbacks of dealing with this decentralized population in the traditional
synchronous manner or in several possible asynchronous update policies. Asynchronous
behavior has proven to be better in many domains such as cellular automata and
distributed GA's, which, in turn, is also the main conclusion of this work. We will
undergo a structured analysis on a set of problems with different features in order to

and their parameters can be decisive for the performance of
evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Usually the type of the operators (such
as Gaussian mutation) remains the same during the entire run and the
probabilistic frequency of their application is determined by a
constant parameter, such as a fixed mutation rate. However, recent
studies have shown that the optimal usage of a variation operator
changes during the EA run. In this study, we combined the idea of
self-adaptive mutation operator scheduling with the Religion-Based EA
(RBEA), which is an agent model with spatially structured and variable
sized subpopulations (religions). In our new model (OSRBEA), we used a
selection of different operators, such that each operator type was
applied within one specific subpopulation only. Our results indicate
that the optimal choice of operators is problem dependent, varies
during the run, and can be handled by our self-adaptive OSRBEA
approach. Operator scheduling could clearly improve the performance of
the already very powerful RBEA and was superior compared to a classic
and other advanced EA approaches.}

We describe the rationale for such a system, and the implementation of a simple version in which the evolving rules are encoded as (condition:action) patterns applied to the problem representation, and
are effectively self-adapted. We investigate the behaviour of the algorithm on a test suite of problems, and show significant performance improvements over a simple Genetic Algorithm, a Memetic Algorithm using a fixed neighbourhood function, and a similar Memetic Algorithm which uses random rules, i.e. with the learning mechanism disabled. 

Analysis of these results enables us to draw some conclusions about the way that even the simplified system is able to discover and exploit different forms of structure and regularities within the
problems.  We suggest that this ``meta-learning'' of problem features provides a means both of creating highly scaleable algorithms, and of capturing features of the solution space in an understandable form.

important to avoid premature convergence and to escape local
optima. Various diversity measures have been used to analyze
algorithms, but so far few algorithms have used a measure to
guide the search.

The diversity-guided evolutionary algorithm (DGEA) uses the well-known
distance-to-average-point measure to alternate between phases of
exploration (mutation) and phases of exploitation (recombination and
selection). The DGEA showed remarkable results on a set of widely used

The DGEA saved a substantial amount of fitness evaluations compared to
the simple EA, which is a critical factor in many real-world applications.}

The integration between the two algorithms is carried out in order to improve the performance of the MOGA by adding the co-operative co-evolutionary effect to the search mechanisms employed by the MOGA. The MOCCGA is benchmarked against the MOGA in six different test cases. The test problems cover six different characteristics that can be found within multi-objective optimisation problems: convex Pareto front, non-convex Pareto front, discrete Pareto front, multi-modality, deceptive Pareto front and non-uniformity in the solution distribution. The simulation results indicate that in overall the MOCCGA is superior to the MOGA in terms of the variety in solutions generated and the closeness of solutions to the true Pareto-optimal solutions. A simple parallel implementation of MOCCGA is described. With an 8-node cluster, the speed up of 2.69 to 4.8 can be achieved for the test problems.}

  abstract = {Setting the mutation rate for an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is confounded by dependence on the problem under study and other details. Nevertheless, much theoretical and empirical work has been done which provides generally accepted guidelines, suggesting that 1/L (where L is chromosome length) is likely to be an optimal or near-optimal rate, and a good starting point for fine-tuning. Here we investigate mutation rates in the context of large-population-parallelism. We justify the claim that considerable speedup can be obtained with raised rates (above that achieved purely as a result of parallelisation), both theoretically and empirically. The simple underlying theory notices that parallelisation favourably alters the fitness distribution of the mutation operator. We derive an expression which sets out how this is changed in terms of the level of parallelisation, and we describe a mutation rate adaptation technique for parallel EAs which uses the derived fitness distribution equations, and compare it with a range of alternatives. Preliminary results suggest that this method can be of strong value in parallel EAs, leading to reliably reduced numbers of generations to find good-quality solutions.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new algorithm for sharing to induce niching and speciation.  Resource-based fitness sharing is a compromise between the very natural method of resource sharing and the practical technique of fitness sharing, introduced by Goldberg and Richardson [1].  Fitness sharing was meant to simulate resource sharing for function optimization problems, in which there are no explicit resources to share.  Fitness sharing therefore cannot resolve resource-defined niches as can resource sharing.  However, the equilib-rium equations for resource sharing are highly non-linear, while those for fit-ness sharing are completely linear.  Selection operators seem to have great dif-ficulty handling the non-linear interactions among shared fitnesses under “natu-ral resource sharing”.  To obtain the benefits of both methods, we propose a sharing function that utilizes actual resources but in a form similar to that of fit-ness sharing, resulting in a set of linear equations for equilibrium, and hence much simpler dynamics under selection.  The superiority of this compromise  is demonstrated on a resource-coverage problem.}

Other numerical results of three well-known benchmark problems¯H1, G7, G10¯also demonstrate the efficacy of our new APEA.

The problem is to order the operations on the machines and on the groups such that the maximal completion time (makespan) of all operations is minimized. The main goal of this paper is to provide a fair comparison of five metaheuristic approaches (i.e., Ant Colony Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithm, Iterated Local Search, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search) to tackle the GSP.

Firstly, we re-examine their capability to simultaneously perform a

to the assumptions made in earlier literature, our results suggest
that these algorithms perform scaling only to a very limited degree. 
We show how to improve on this by some modifications of the algorithm

Secondly, we show how the time-complexity of these algorithms can 
substantially be improved to make them suitable for interactive and

Agents use modified rules of the standard flock algorithm to transform an agent (boid) into a hunter foraging for clusters in spatial data.

The approach operating at the level of whole rule-bases yielded more robust and stable convergence on high performance solutions than any other architecture presented here.

  abstract = {In evolution strategies with neighborhood attraction (EN) the concepts of
neighborhood cooperativeness and learning rules known from neural maps 
are transferred onto the individuals of evolution strategies. 
A previous approach, which utilized a neighborhood relationship adapted from
self-organizing maps (SOM), appeared to perform as well
as or even better than comparable conventional evolution strategies on a
variety of common test functions.
In this contribution, an EN with a new neighborhood relationship and learning
rule based on the idea of neural gas is introduced. Its performance
is compared to the SOM-like approach, using the same test functions.
It is shown that the neural gas approach is considerably
faster in finding the optimum than the SOM approach, although the
latter seems to be more robust for multi-modal problems.  }

Instead of the probabilistic acceptance of MSXF, the best candidate of neighbors is selected definitely as the next step solution. The performance of dMSXF is tested on 1max problem and Traveling Salesman Problem, and its superiority to conventional methods, e.g. uniform crossover, is shown.

The paper begins by devising a definition of inseparable function interaction, identifying the challenges and presenting a review of relevant literature.  It then briefly describes Generalised Regression GA (GRGA) for handling inseparable function interaction in multi-objective optimisation problems. GRGA is applied to a complex test problem and two real-life case studies in the area of engineering design optimisation. This compares its performance to that of NSGA-II, which is a high-performing evolutionary-based multi-objective optimisation algorithm. The paper concludes by giving the limitations of GRGA and the future research directions. }

The player's behaviour is defined using a LISP like scripting language.  While the game interprets scripts in real-time, such scripts are evolved off-line by a second program which simulates the real-time application.  This method is used, as on-line evolution of the players would be too time consuming.  A successful player needs to satisfy multiple conflicting objectives.  This problem is addressed by the use of an automatically defined function (ADF) for each of these objectives in combination with task specific fitness functions.  The overall fitness of evolved scripts is evaluated by a conventional fitness function.  In addition to that, each of the ADFs is evaluated with a separate fitness function, tailored specifically to the objective that needs to be satisfied by that ADF.}

The population is composed of potential parsings for a

their application still corresponds to the words in

This goal is complicated by the fact that, for common multifactorial diseases such as hypertension, interactions between genetic variations are likely to be more important than the independent effects of any single genetic variation.  Attribute interaction is a well-known problem in data mining and is a complicating factor in genetic data analysis.  We have previously addressed this problem by developing a parallel approach to problem solving that utilizes one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) for knowledge representation and genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization.  In this study, we evaluate the power of this parallel CA approach by simulating gene-gene interactions and adding noise from several common real-world sources.  These simulation studies document the strengths of the CA approach and document a weakness that needs to be addressed.}

In contrast to static optimization, the objective in dynamic optimization is to continuously adapt the solution to a changing environment -- a task that evolutionary algorithms are believed to be good at. At the time being, however, almost all knowledge with regard to the performance of evolutionary algorithms in dynamic environments is of an empirical nature. In this paper, tools devised originally for the analysis in static environments are applied to study the performance of a popular type of recombinative evolution strategy with cumulative mutation strength adaptation on a dynamic problem. With relatively little effort, scaling laws that quite accurately describe the behavior of the strategy and that greatly contribute to its understanding are derived and their implications are discussed.

  abstract = {This work introduces a new recombination and a new mutation operator for an accelerated evolutionary algorithm in the context of Pareto optimization. Both operators are based on a self-organizing map, which is actively learning from the evolution in order to adapt the mutation step size and improve convergence speed. Standard selection operators can be used in conjunction with these operators.
The new operators are applied to the Pareto optimization of an airfoil for minimizing the aerodynamic profile losses at the design operating point and maximizing the operating range. The profile performance is analyzed with a quasi 3D computational fluid dynamics (Q3D CFD) solver for the design condition and two off-design conditions (one positive and one negative incidence).
The new concept is to define a free scaling factor, which is multiplied to the off-design incidences. The scaling factor is considered as an additional design variable and at the same time as objective function for indexing the operating range, which has to be maximized. We show that 2 off-design incidences are sufficient for the Pareto optimization and that the computation of a complete loss polar is not necessary. In addition, this approach answers the question of how to set the incidence values by defining them as design variables of the optimization.

  abstract = {Solving a multi-objective problem means to find a set of solutions called the Pareto frontier. 
Since evolutionary algorithms  work on a population of solutions, they are well-adapted to multi-objective problems. 
When they are designed, two purposes are taken into account: they have to reach the Pareto frontier but they also have to find solutions all along the frontier.
It is the intensification task and the diversification task. Mechanisms dealing with these goals exist. 
But with very hard problems or benchmarks of great size, they may not be effective enough. 
In this paper, we investigate the utilization of parallel and hybrid models to improve the intensification task and the diversification task. 
First, a new technique inspired by the elitism is used to improve the diversification task. 
This new method must be implemented by a parallel model to be useful. 
Second, in order to amplify the diversification task and the intensification task, the parallel model is extended to a more general island model. 
To help the intensification task, a hybrid model is also used. 
In this model, a specially defined parallel tabu search is applied to the Pareto frontier reached by an evolutionary algorithm. 
Finally, those models are implemented and tested on a bi-objective vehicle routing problem.}

  abstract = {SOAP (simple object access protocol) is a protocol that allows the access to remote objects independently of the computer architecture and the language. 
A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. 
Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets).

In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. 

Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. 
Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.}

In this paper we present results from the use of XCS on simple tasks with the general multi-variable features typically found in problems addressed by an Interactive Evolutionary Design process. That is, we examine the behaviour of XCS with versions of a well-known single-step task and consider the speed of learning and the ability to respond to changes. We introduce a simple form of supervised learning for XCS with the aim of improving its performance with respect to these two measures. Results show that improvements can be made under the new learning scheme and that other aspects of XCS can also play a significant role.}

  abstract = {When using representations for genetic algorithms (GAs) 
every optimization problem can be separated into a 
genotype-phenotype and a phenotype-fitness mapping. 
The genotype-phenotype mapping is the used representation 
and the phenotype-fitness mapping is the problem that 
should be solved.

This paper investigates how the use of different binary 
representations of integers influences the performance of 
selectorecombinative GAs using only crossover and no 
mutation. It is illustrated that the used representation 
strongly influences the  performance of GAs.
The binary and gray encoding are two examples for 
assigning bitstring genotypes to integer phenotypes. 
Focusing the investigation on these two encodings reveals 
that for the easy integer one-max problem 
selectorecombinative GAs perform better using  binary 
encoding than using  gray encoding. This is surprising as 
binary encoding is affected with problems due to the 
Hamming cliff and because there are proofs that show the 
superiority of gray encoding. However, the performance of 
selectorecombinative GAs using binary representations of 
integers is determined by the resulting building blocks 
(BBs) and not by the structure of the search space 
resulting from the Hamming distances between the 
individuals. Therefore, the performance difference between 
the encodings can be explained by analyzing the fitness of 
the resulting schemata.}

  functions subject to a set of restrictions. In genetic algorithms
  the techniques for coping with such restrictions are manifold:
  penalty functions, keeping the population in the feasible region,
  etc. Mutation and crossover operators must take into account the
  specific features of this kind of optimization problems, as they are
  the responsible if the generation of new individuals.
  
  In this work we make an analysis of the influence of the election of
  the crossover operator in  the problem of function optimization with
  restrictions. We focus our  work  on the crossover operator  because
  this operator is the  most characteristic of genetic algorithms.  We
  have   used a test  set  that  includes  functions  with  linear and
  non-linear restrictions.
  
  The results confirm the importance of crossover operator, as great
  differences are observed in the performance of the studied crossover
  operators. A new crossover, the crossover based on confidence
  intervals shows the most robust behavior.}

  abstract = {Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) have been applied to
many optimization problems with varied success.  Recent empirical
studies have shown that choices surrounding methods of collaboration
may have a strong impact on the success of the algorithm.  Moreover,
certain properties of the problem landscape, such as variable
interaction, greatly influence how these choices should be made.  A
more general view of variable interaction is one that considers
epistatic linkages which span population boundaries.  Such linkages
can be caused by the decomposition of the actual problem, as well as
by CCEA representation decisions regarding population structure.  We
posit that it is the way in which represented problem
components interact, and not necessarily the existence of
cross-population epistatic linkages that impacts these decisions.  In
order to explore this issue, we identify two different kinds of
representational bias with respect to the population structure
of the algorithm, decompositional bias and linkage bias.
We provide analysis and constructive examples which help illustrate
that even when the algorithm's representation is poorly suited for the
problem, the choice of how best to select collaborators can be
unaffected.

the proposed GA can attain high quality solutions
for typical benchmark problems without tedious
parameter tuning.
