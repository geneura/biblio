                 CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS

                 We have presented a new implementation of GP - based on
                 MPI - which allows us to make use of parallelism as
                 well as experimenting with different communication
                 topologies and GP parameters

                 We have compared performances of this methodology
                 ?PADGP ? with classic GP. The tool was applied to the
                 study of two important parameters that affect
                 convergence results on PADGP: the number and size of
                 populations. By means of this study, we have observed
                 the existence of a region of effort which defines the
                 best number of individuals we must use when employing a
                 given number of populations with PADGP.

                 This region of effort has been detected both in
                 benchmark problems and in ?real life? problems.

                 We have also presented random topology as a way of
                 improving convergence when using PADGP.

                 We have used PADGP with random topology and compared it
                 to classic GP. This comparison showed that the former
                 gives better results.

                 We have also compared random topology and grid topology
                 and we have shown that results are similar.
                 Nevertheless random topology requires a smaller amount
                 of communication processes.

                 We have presented a methodology that is based on PADGP,
                 and which aids medical diagnosing. We used this problem
                 to check the validity of results obtained in the
                 benchmark problem, while we also proposed PADGP as an
                 appropriate methodology for extracting medical
                 knowledge.

                 We have studied isolated subpopulations (IMGP) as a
                 limit case of PADGP and we have experimentally seen
                 that IMGP obtains similar convergence results than GP;
                 sometimes results are even better if the total number
                 of individuals is high.

                 We have then dealt with an optimisation problem: the
                 problem of placement and routing on FPGAs. We have
                 developed a new methodology based on GP, and this
                 allows us to represent circuits by means of GP trees.
                 Furthermore, the methodology achieved the proposed
                 goal: finding several ways of placing and routing
                 circuits on reconfigurable hardware. The problem was
                 later used for checking the conclusions which had been
                 reached in the first part of this research. All
                 statistical results obtained are in agreement with
                 those obtained from benchmark problems.

                 We think that the main goals we established at the
                 beginning have been achieved: checking the usefulness
                 of PADGP with random communications and developing a
                 methodology for logic synthesis on FPGAs. In the
                 researching process we discovered the concept of region
                 of effort and we obtained interesting conclusions via
                 the use of IMGP.

                 Results we obtained during our research have been
                 published in the main conferences and reviews that deal
                 with the different topics addressed in this thesis (see
                 References).",

                 experimental investigation of the behavior of
                 multipopulation GP [2] and we have empirically observed
                 that distributing the individuals among several loosely
                 connected islands allows not only to save computation
                 time, due to the fact that the system runs on multiple
                 machines, but also to find better solution quality.
                 These results have often been attributed to better
                 diversity maintenance due to the periodic migration of
                 groups of {"}good{"} individuals among the
                 subpopulations. We also believe that this might be the
                 case and we study the evolution of diversity in
                 multi-island GP. All the diversity measures that we use
                 in this paper are based on the concept of entropy of a
                 population , defined as . If we are considering
                 phenotypic diversity, we define Fj as the fraction of
                 individuals in having a certain fitness , where is the
                 total number of fitness values in . In this case, the
                 entropy measure will be indicated as or simply Hp. To
                 define genotypic diversity, we use two different
                 techniques. The first one consists in partitioning
                 individuals in such a way that only identical
                 individuals belong to the same group. In this case, we
                 have considered Fj as the fraction of trees in the
                 population having a certain genotype , where is the
                 total number of genotypes in and the entropy measure
                 will be indicated as or simply HG. The second technique
                 consists in defining a distance measure, able to
                 quantify the genotypic diversity between two trees. In
                 this case, Fj is the fraction of individuals having a
                 given distance from a fixed tree (called origin), where
                 is the total number of distance values from the origin
                 appearing in and the entropy measure will be indicated
                 as or simply Hg. The tree distance used is Ekart's and

                 during GP runs. After defining suitable genotypic and
                 phenotypic diversity measures, we apply them to three
                 standard test problems. The experimental results

                 performance observed for distributed GP with respect to
                 panmictic GP. Finally, we trace a sort of history of

                 presented comprising synchronous and asynchronous
                 communication. These three models are compared with
                 each other and with the standard panmictic model on
                 three well known Genetic Programming benchmarks. The
                 measures used are the computational effort, the
                 phenotypic entropy of the populations, and the
                 execution time. We find that all the distributed models
                 are better than the sequential one in terms of effort
                 and time. The differences among the distributed models
                 themselves are rather small in terms of effort but one
                 of the asynchronous models turns out to be
                 significantly faster. The entropy confirms that
                 migration helps in conserving some phenotypic diversity
                 in the populations.",

  abstract =     "The parallel execution of several populations in
                 evolutionary algorithms has usually given good results.
                 Nevertheless, researchers have to date drawn
                 conflicting conclusions when using some of the parallel
                 genetic programming models. One aspect of the conflict
                 is population size, since published GP works do not
                 agree about whether to use large or small populations.
                 This paper presents an experimental study of a number
                 of common GP test problems. Via our experiments, we
                 discovered that an optimal range of values exists. This
                 assists us in our choice of population size and in the
                 selection of an appropriate parallel genetic
                 programming model. Finding efficient parameters helps
                 us to speed up our search for solutions. At the same
                 time, it allows us to locate features that are common
                 to parallel genetic programming and the classic genetic
                 programming technique.",

                 comparing classic genetic programming (GP) with the
                 isolated multipopulation version. Our first discovery
                 was that sometimes, given a certain number of
                 individuals, it is useful to distribute them among
                 several populations even when no communication is
                 allowed. This consequently lead to research
                 concentrating on three main questions: firstly, how to
                 distribute individuals according to the problem in
                 hand; secondly, how many populations must be employed
                 in proportion to the effort and fitness involved when
                 solving a problem; and finally, how to use isolated
                 multipopulation GP in the classification of problems.",
